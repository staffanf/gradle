== The Java Library Plugin

The Java Library plugin expands the capabilities of the Java plugin by providing specific knowledge about Java libraries. In particular, a Java library exposes an API to consumers (i.e., other projects using the Java or the Java Library plugin). All the source sets, tasks and configurations exposed by the Java plugin are implicitly available when using this plugin.


[[sec:java_library_usage]]
=== Usage

To use the Java Library plugin, include the following in your build script:

++++
<sample id="useJavaLibraryPlugin" dir="java-library/quickstart" title="Using the Java Library plugin">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="use-plugin"/>
        </sample>
++++


[[sec:java_library_separation]]
=== API and implementation separation

The key difference between the standard Java plugin and the Java Library plugin is that the latter introduces the concept of an _API_ exposed to consumers. A library is a Java component meant to be consumed by other components. It's a very common use case in multi-project builds, but also as soon as you have external dependencies.

The plugin exposes two <<configurations,configurations>> that can be used to declare dependencies: `api` and `implementation`. The `api` configuration should be used to declare dependencies which are exported by the library API, whereas the `implementation` configuration should be used to declare dependencies which are internal to the component.

++++
<sample id="useJavaLibraryPlugin" dir="java-library/quickstart" title="Declaring API and implementation dependencies">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="dependencies"/>
        </sample>
++++

Dependencies appearing in the `api` configurations will be transitively exposed to consumers of the library, and as such will appear on the compile classpath of consumers. Dependencies found in the `implementation` configuration will, on the other hand, not be exposed to consumers, and therefore not leak into the consumers' compile classpath. This comes with several benefits:

* dependencies do not leak into the compile classpath of consumers anymore, so you will never accidentally depend on a transitive dependency
* faster compilation thanks to reduced classpath size
* less recompilations when implementation dependencies change: consumers would not need to be recompiled
* cleaner publishing: when used in conjunction with the new `maven-publish` plugin, Java libraries produce POM files that distinguish exactly between what is required to compile against the library and what is required to use the library at runtime (in other words, don't mix what is needed to compile the library itself and what is needed to compile against the library).

NOTE: The `compile` configuration still exists but should not be used as it will not offer the guarantees that the `api` and `implementation` configurations provide.

[[sec:java_library_recognizing_dependencies]]
=== Recognizing API and implementation dependencies

This section will help you spot API and Implementation dependencies in your code using simple rules of thumb. Basically, an API dependency is a type that is exposed in the library binary interface, often referred to ABI (Application Binary Interface). This includes, but is not limited to:

* types used in super classes or interfaces
* types used in public method parameters, including generic parameter types (where _public_ is something that is visible to compilers. I.e. , _public_, _protected_ and _package private_ members in the Java world)
* types used in public fields
* public annotation types

In opposition, any type that is used in the following list is irrelevant to the ABI, and therefore should be declared as `implementation` dependency:

* types exclusively used in method bodies
* types exclusively used in private members
* types exclusively found in internal classes (future versions of Gradle will let you declare which packages belong to the public API)

In the following sample, we can make the difference between an API dependency and an implementation dependency:

++++
<sample id="useJavaLibraryPlugin" dir="java-library/quickstart" title="Making the difference between API and implementation">
            <sourcefile file="src/main/java/org/gradle/HttpClientWrapper.java" snippet="sample"/>
        </sample>
++++

We can see that our class imports third party classes, but imports alone won't tell us if a dependency is an API or implementation dependency. For this, we need to look at the methods. The public constructor of `HttpClientWrapper` uses `HttpClient` as a parameter, so it exposed to consumers and therefore belongs to the API.

On the other hand, the `ExceptionUtils` type, coming from the `commons-lang` library, is only used in a method body, so it's an implementation dependency.

Therefore, we can deduce that `commons-httpclient` is an API dependency, whereas `commons-lang` is an implementation dependency, which directly translates into the build file:

++++
<sample id="useJavaLibraryPlugin" dir="java-library/quickstart" title="Declaring API and implementation dependencies">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="dependencies"/>
        </sample>
++++

As a guideline, you should prefer the `implementation` configuration first: leakage of implementation types to consumers would then directly lead to a compile error of consumers, which would be solved either by removing the type from the public API, or promoting the dependency as an API dependency instead.

[[sec:java_library_configurations_graph]]
=== The Java Library plugin configurations

The following graph describes the main configurations setup when the Java Library plugin is in use.
<imageobject> <imagedata fileref="img/java-library-ignore-deprecated-main.png"/> </imageobject>
* The configurations in _green_ are the ones a user should use to declare dependencies
* The configurations in _pink_ are the ones used when a component compiles, or runs against the library
* The configurations in _blue_ are internal to the component, for its own use
* The configurations in _white_ are configurations inherited from the Java plugin

And the next graph describes the test configurations setup:
<imageobject> <imagedata fileref="img/java-library-ignore-deprecated-test.png"/> </imageobject>
NOTE: The _compile_, _testCompile_, _runtime_ and _testRuntime_ configurations inherited from the Java plugin are still available but are deprecated. You should avoid using them, as they are only kept for backwards compatibility.

The role of each configuration is described in the following tables:

.Java Library plugin - configurations used to declare dependencies

=== Known issues


[[sec:java_library_known_issues_compat]]
==== Compatibility with other plugins

At the moment the Java Library plugin is only wired to behave correctly with the `java` plugin. Other plugins, such as the Groovy plugin, may not behave correctly. In particular, if the Groovy plugin is used in addition to the `java-library` plugin, then consumers may not get the Groovy classes when they consume the library. To workaround this, you need to explicitly wire the Groovy compile dependency, like this:

++++
<sample id="useGroovyPlugin" dir="java-library/with-groovy" title="Configuring the Groovy plugin to work with Java Library">
                <sourcefile file="a/build.gradle" snippet="configure-groovy"/>
            </sample>
++++


[[sec:java_library_known_issues_memory]]
==== Increased memory usage for consumers

When a project uses the Java Library plugin, consumers will use the output classes directory of this project directly on their compile classpath, instead of the jar file if the project uses the Java plugin. An indirect consequence is that up-to-date checking will require more memory, because Gradle will snapshot individual class files instead of a single jar. This may lead to increased memory consumption for large projects.
