== The Build Announcements Plugin

NOTE:  The build announcements plugin is currently <<feature_lifecycle,incubating>>. Please be aware that the DSL and other configuration may change in later Gradle versions. 

The build announcements plugin uses the <<announce_plugin,announce>> plugin to send local announcements on important events in the build.


[[sec:build_announcements_usage]]
=== Usage

To use the build announcements plugin, include the following in your build script:

++++
<sample id="useBuildAnnouncementsPlugin" dir="announce" title="Using the build announcements plugin">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="use-build-announcements-plugin"/>
        </sample>
++++

That's it. If you want to tweak where the announcements go, you can configure the <<announce_plugin,announce>> plugin to change the local announcer.

You can also apply the plugin from an init script:

++++
<sample id="useBuildAnnouncementsPlugin" dir="announce" title="Using the build announcements plugin from an init script">
            <sourcefile file="init.gradle"/>
            <test args="-I init.gradle"/>
        </sample>
++++
