[[publishing_ivy]]
== Ivy Publishing (new)

NOTE:  This chapter describes the new <<feature_lifecycle,incubating>> Ivy publishing support provided by the “`ivy-publish`” plugin. Eventually this new publishing support will replace publishing via the `Upload` task.  If you are looking for documentation on the original Ivy publishing support using the `Upload` task please see <<artifact_management>>. 

This chapter describes how to publish build artifacts in the http://ant.apache.org/ivy/[Apache Ivy] format, usually to a repository for consumption by other builds or projects. What is published is one or more artifacts created by the build, and an Ivy _module descriptor_ (normally `ivy.xml`) that describes the artifacts and the dependencies of the artifacts, if any.

A published Ivy module can be consumed by Gradle (see <<dependency_management>>) and other tools that understand the Ivy format.


[[publishing_ivy:plugin]]
=== The “`ivy-publish`” Plugin

The ability to publish in the Ivy format is provided by the “`ivy-publish`” plugin.

The “`publishing`” plugin creates an extension on the project named “`publishing`” of type api:org.gradle.api.publish.PublishingExtension[]. This extension provides a container of named publications and a container of named repositories. The “`ivy-publish`” plugin works with api:org.gradle.api.publish.ivy.IvyPublication[] publications and api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.repositories.IvyArtifactRepository[] repositories.

++++
<sample id="publishing_ivy:apply-plugin-snippet" dir="ivy-publish/quickstart" title="Applying the “ivy-publish” plugin">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="use-plugin"/>
        </sample>
++++

Applying the “`ivy-publish`” plugin does the following:

* Applies the “`publishing`” plugin
* Establishes a rule to automatically create a api:org.gradle.api.publish.ivy.tasks.GenerateIvyDescriptor[] task for each api:org.gradle.api.publish.ivy.IvyPublication[] added (see <<publishing_ivy:publications>>).
* Establishes a rule to automatically create a api:org.gradle.api.publish.ivy.tasks.PublishToIvyRepository[] task for the combination of each api:org.gradle.api.publish.ivy.IvyPublication[] added (see <<publishing_ivy:publications>>), with each api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.repositories.IvyArtifactRepository[] added (see <<publishing_ivy:repositories>>).


[[publishing_ivy:publications]]
=== Publications

NOTE:  If you are not familiar with project artifacts and configurations, you should read <<artifact_management>>, which introduces these concepts. This chapter also describes “publishing artifacts” using a different mechanism than what is described in this chapter. The publishing functionality described here will eventually supersede that functionality. 

Publication objects describe the structure/configuration of a publication to be created. Publications are published to repositories via tasks, and the configuration of the publication object determines exactly what is published. All of the publications of a project are defined in the api:org.gradle.api.publish.PublishingExtension#getPublications()[] container. Each publication has a unique name within the project.

For the “`ivy-publish`” plugin to have any effect, an api:org.gradle.api.publish.ivy.IvyPublication[] must be added to the set of publications. This publication determines which artifacts are actually published as well as the details included in the associated Ivy module descriptor file. A publication can be configured by adding components, customizing artifacts, and by modifying the generated module descriptor file directly.


[[sec:publishing_component_to_ivy]]
==== Publishing a Software Component

The simplest way to publish a Gradle project to an Ivy repository is to specify a api:org.gradle.api.component.SoftwareComponent[] to publish. The components presently available for publication are:

.Software Components
[cols="a,a,a,a"]
|===
| Name
| Provided By
| Artifacts
| Dependencies

| `java`
| <<java_plugin,Java Plugin>>
| Generated jar file
| Dependencies from 'runtime' configuration

| `web`
| <<war_plugin,War Plugin>>
| Generated war file
| No dependencies
|===

In the following example, artifacts and runtime dependencies are taken from the `java` component, which is added by the `Java Plugin`.

++++
<sample dir="ivy-publish/quickstart" id="publishing_ivy:publish-component-snippet" title="Publishing a Java module to Ivy">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="publish-component"/>
            </sample>
++++


[[sec:publishing_custom_artifacts_to_ivy]]
==== Publishing custom artifacts

It is also possible to explicitly configure artifacts to be included in the publication. Artifacts are commonly supplied as raw files, or as instances of api:org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.AbstractArchiveTask[] (e.g. Jar, Zip).

For each custom artifact, it is possible to specify the `name`, `extension`, `type`, `classifier` and `conf` values to use for publication. Note that each artifacts must have a unique name/classifier/extension combination.

Configure custom artifacts as follows:

++++
<sample dir="ivy-publish/java-multi-project" id="publishing_ivy:publish-custom-artifact-snippet" title="Publishing additional artifact to Ivy">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="publish-custom-artifact"/>
            </sample>
++++

See the api:org.gradle.api.publish.ivy.IvyPublication[] class in the API documentation for more detailed information on how artifacts can be customized.

[[sec:identity_values_for_the_published_project]]
==== Identity values for the published project

The generated Ivy module descriptor file contains an `&lt;info&gt;` element that identifies the module. The default identity values are derived from the following:

* `organisation` - api:org.gradle.api.Project#getGroup()[]
* `module` - api:org.gradle.api.Project#getName()[]
* `revision` - api:org.gradle.api.Project#getVersion()[]
* `status` - api:org.gradle.api.Project#getStatus()[]
* `branch` - (not set)

Overriding the default identity values is easy: simply specify the `organisation`, `module` or `revision` attributes when configuring the `IvyPublication`. The `status` and `branch` attributes can be set via the `descriptor` property (see api:org.gradle.api.publish.ivy.IvyModuleDescriptorSpec[]). The `descriptor` property can also be used to add additional custom elements as children of the `&lt;info&gt;` element.

++++
<sample dir="ivy-publish/multiple-publications" id="publishing_ivy:publish-customize-identity" title="customizing the publication identity">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="customize-identity"/>
            </sample>
++++

TIP: Certain repositories are not able to handle all supported characters. For example, the ':' character cannot be used as an identifier when publishing to a filesystem-backed repository on Windows.

Gradle will handle any valid Unicode character for organisation, module and revision (as well as artifact name, extension and classifier). The only values that are explicitly prohibited are '`\`', '`/`' and any ISO control character. The supplied values are validated early during publication.

[[sec:modifying_the_generated_module_descriptor]]
==== Modifying the generated module descriptor

At times, the module descriptor file generated from the project information will need to be tweaked before publishing. The “`ivy-publish`” plugin provides a hook to allow such modification.

++++
<sample dir="ivy-publish/descriptor-customization" id="publishing_ivy:descriptor-customization-snippet" title="Customizing the module descriptor file">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="customize-descriptor"/>
            </sample>
++++

In this example we are simply adding a 'description' element to the generated Ivy dependency descriptor, but this hook allows you to modify any aspect of the generated descriptor. For example, you could replace the version range for a dependency with the actual version used to produce the build.

See api:org.gradle.api.publish.ivy.IvyModuleDescriptorSpec#withXml(org.gradle.api.Action)[] in the API documentation for more information.

It is possible to modify virtually any aspect of the created descriptor should you need to. This means that it is also possible to modify the descriptor in such a way that it is no longer a valid Ivy module descriptor, so care must be taken when using this feature.

The identifier (organisation, module, revision) of the published module is an exception; these values cannot be modified in the descriptor using the `withXML` hook.

[[sec:publishing_multiple_modules_to_ivy]]
==== Publishing multiple modules

Sometimes it's useful to publish multiple modules from your Gradle build, without creating a separate Gradle subproject. An example is publishing a separate API and implementation jar for your library. With Gradle this is simple:

++++
<sample dir="ivy-publish/multiple-publications" id="publishing_ivy:publish-multiple-publications" title="Publishing multiple modules from a single project">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="multiple-publications"/>
            </sample>
++++

If a project defines multiple publications then Gradle will publish each of these to the defined repositories. Each publication must be given a unique identity as described above.

[[publishing_ivy:repositories]]
=== Repositories

Publications are published to repositories. The repositories to publish to are defined by the api:org.gradle.api.publish.PublishingExtension#getRepositories()[] container.

++++
<sample dir="ivy-publish/quickstart" id="publishing_ivy:sample_repositories" title="Declaring repositories to publish to">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="repositories"/>
        </sample>
++++

The DSL used to declare repositories for publishing is the same DSL that is used to declare repositories for dependencies (api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.RepositoryHandler[]). However, in the context of Ivy publication only the repositories created by the `ivy()` methods can be used as publication destinations. You cannot publish an `IvyPublication` to a Maven repository for example.

[[publishing_ivy:publishing]]
=== Performing a publish

The “`ivy-publish`” plugin automatically creates a api:org.gradle.api.publish.ivy.tasks.PublishToIvyRepository[] task for each api:org.gradle.api.publish.ivy.IvyPublication[] and api:org.gradle.api.artifacts.repositories.IvyArtifactRepository[] combination in the `publishing.publications` and `publishing.repositories` containers respectively.

The created task is named “`publish«_PUBNAME_»PublicationTo«_REPONAME_»Repository`”, which is “`publishIvyJavaPublicationToIvyRepository`” for this example. This task is of type api:org.gradle.api.publish.ivy.tasks.PublishToIvyRepository[].

++++
<sample dir="ivy-publish/quickstart" id="publishingIvyPublishSingle" title="Choosing a particular publication to publish">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle"/>
            <output args="publishIvyJavaPublicationToIvyRepository"/>
        </sample>
++++


[[sec:the_publish_lifecycle_task]]
==== The “`publish`” lifecycle task

The “`publish`” plugin (that the “`ivy-publish`” plugin implicitly applies) adds a lifecycle task that can be used to publish all publications to all applicable repositories named “`publish`”.

In more concrete terms, executing this task will execute all api:org.gradle.api.publish.ivy.tasks.PublishToIvyRepository[] tasks in the project. This is usually the most convenient way to perform a publish.

++++
<sample dir="ivy-publish/quickstart" id="publishingIvyPublishLifecycle" title="Publishing all publications via the “publish” lifecycle task">
                <output args="publish"/>
            </sample>
++++


[[publishing_ivy:descriptor]]
=== Generating the Ivy module descriptor file without publishing

At times it is useful to generate the Ivy module descriptor file (normally `ivy.xml`) without publishing your module to an Ivy repository. Since descriptor file generation is performed by a separate task, this is very easy to do.

The “`ivy-publish`” plugin creates one api:org.gradle.api.publish.ivy.tasks.GenerateIvyDescriptor[] task for each registered api:org.gradle.api.publish.ivy.IvyPublication[], named “`generateDescriptorFileFor«_PUBNAME_»Publication`”, which will be “`generateDescriptorFileForIvyJavaPublication`” for the previous example of the “`ivyJava`” publication.

You can specify where the generated Ivy file will be located by setting the `destination` property on the generated task. By default this file is written to “`build/publications/«_PUBNAME_»/ivy.xml`”.

++++
<sample dir="ivy-publish/descriptor-customization" id="publishingIvyGenerateDescriptor" title="Generating the Ivy module descriptor file">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="generate"/>
            <output args="generateDescriptorFileForIvyCustomPublication"/>
        </sample>
++++

NOTE:  The “`ivy-publish`” plugin leverages some experimental support for late plugin configuration, and the `GenerateIvyDescriptor` task will not be constructed until the publishing extension is configured. The simplest way to ensure that the publishing plugin is configured when you attempt to access the `GenerateIvyDescriptor` task is to place the access inside a `model` block, as the example above demonstrates.  The same applies to any attempt to access publication-specific tasks like api:org.gradle.api.publish.ivy.tasks.PublishToIvyRepository[]. These tasks should be referenced from within a `model` block. 

[[publishing_ivy:example]]
=== Complete example

The following example demonstrates publishing with a multi-project build. Each project publishes a Java component and a configured additional source artifact. The descriptor file is customized to include the project description for each project.

++++
<sample dir="ivy-publish/java-multi-project" id="publishing_ivy:complete_example" title="Publishing a Java module">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle"/>
        </sample>
++++

The result is that the following artifacts will be published for each project:

* The Ivy module descriptor file: “`ivy-1.0.xml`”.
* The primary “jar” artifact for the Java component: “`project1-1.0.jar`”.
* The source “jar” artifact that has been explicitly configured: “`project1-1.0-source.jar`”.

When `project1` is published, the module descriptor (i.e. the `ivy.xml` file) that is produced will look like:

TIP:  
Note that `«PUBLICATION-TIME-STAMP»` in this example Ivy module descriptor will be the timestamp of when the descriptor was generated.
 

++++
<sample dir="ivy-publish/java-multi-project" id="publishing_ivy:output_ivy.xml" title="Example generated ivy.xml">
            <sourcefile file="output-ivy.xml" snippet="content"/>
        </sample>
++++


[[publishing_ivy:future]]
=== Future features

The “`ivy-publish`” plugin functionality as described above is incomplete, as the feature is still <<feature_lifecycle,incubating>>. In upcoming Gradle releases, the functionality will be expanded to include (but not limited to):

* Convenient customization of module attributes (`module`, `organisation` etc.)
* Convenient customization of dependencies reported in `module descriptor`.
* Multiple discrete publications per project
