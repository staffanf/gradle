== The Application Plugin

The Application plugin facilitates creating an executable JVM application. It makes it easy to start the application locally during development, and to package the application as a TAR and/or ZIP including operating system specific start scripts.

Applying the Application plugin also implicitly applies the <<java_plugin,Java plugin>>. The `main` source set is effectively the “application”.

Applying the Application plugin also implicitly applies the <<distribution_plugin,Distribution plugin>>. A `main` distribution is created that packages up the application, including code dependencies and generated start scripts.


[[sec:application_usage]]
=== Usage

To use the application plugin, include the following in your build script:

++++
<sample id="useApplicationPlugin" dir="application" title="Using the application plugin">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="use-plugin"/>
        </sample>
++++

The only mandatory configuration for the plugin is the specification of the main class (i.e. entry point) of the application.

++++
<sample id="useApplicationPlugin" dir="application" title="Configure the application main class">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="mainClassName-conf"/>
        </sample>
++++

You can run the application by executing the [userinput]#run# task (type: api:org.gradle.api.tasks.JavaExec[]). This will compile the main source set, and launch a new JVM with its classes (along with all runtime dependencies) as the classpath and using the specified main class. You can launch the application in debug mode with [userinput]#gradle run --debug-jvm# (see api:org.gradle.api.tasks.JavaExec#setDebug(boolean)[]).

If your application requires a specific set of JVM settings or system properties, you can configure the `applicationDefaultJvmArgs` property. These JVM arguments are applied to the `run` task and also considered in the generated start scripts of your distribution.

++++
<sample id="configureApplicationDefaultJvmArgs" dir="application" title="Configure default JVM settings">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="application-defaultjvmargs"/>
        </sample>
++++


[[sec:the_distribution]]
==== The distribution

A distribution of the application can be created, by way of the <<distribution_plugin,Distribution plugin>> (which is automatically applied). A `main` distribution is created with the following content:

.Distribution content
[cols="a,a"]
|===
| Location
| Content

| (root dir)
| `src/dist`

| `lib`
| All runtime dependencies and main source set class files.

| `bin`
| Start scripts (generated by `createStartScripts` task).
|===

Static files to be added to the distribution can be simply added to `src/dist`. More advanced customization can be done by configuring the api:org.gradle.api.file.CopySpec[] exposed by the main distribution.

++++
<sample id="includeTaskOutputInApplicationDistribution" dir="application" title="Include output from other tasks in the application distribution">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="distribution-spec"/>
            </sample>
++++

By specifying that the distribution should include the task's output files (see <<sec:task_inputs_outputs>>), Gradle knows that the task that produces the files must be invoked before the distribution can be assembled and will take care of this for you.

++++
<sample id="dependentTaskForApplicationDistributionOutput" dir="application" title="Automatically creating files for distribution">
                <output args="distZip"/>
            </sample>
++++

You can run [userinput]#gradle installDist# to create an image of the application in `build/install/<replaceable>projectName</replaceable>`. You can run [userinput]#gradle distZip# to create a ZIP containing the distribution, [userinput]#gradle distTar# to create an application TAR or [userinput]#gradle assemble# to build both.

[[sec:customizing_start_script_generation]]
==== Customizing start script generation

The application plugin can generate Unix (suitable for Linux, Mac OS X etc.) and Windows start scripts out of the box. The start scripts launch a JVM with the specified settings defined as part of the original build and runtime environment (e.g. `JAVA_OPTS` env var). The default script templates are based on the same scripts used to launch Gradle itself, that ship as part of a Gradle distribution.

The start scripts are completely customizable. Please refer to the documentation of api:org.gradle.jvm.application.tasks.CreateStartScripts[] for more details and customization examples.

[[sec:application_tasks]]
=== Tasks

The Application plugin adds the following tasks to the project.

.Application plugin - tasks
[cols="a,a,a,a"]
|===
| Task name
| Depends on
| Type
| Description

| `run`
| `classes`
| api:org.gradle.api.tasks.JavaExec[]
| Starts the application.

| `startScripts`
| `jar`
| api:org.gradle.api.tasks.application.CreateStartScripts[]
| Creates OS specific scripts to run the project as a JVM application.

| `installDist`
| `jar`, `startScripts`
| api:org.gradle.api.tasks.Sync[]
| Installs the application into a specified directory.

| `distZip`
| `jar`, `startScripts`
| api:org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Zip[]
| Creates a full distribution ZIP archive including runtime libraries and OS specific scripts.

| `distTar`
| `jar`, `startScripts`
| api:org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Tar[]
| Creates a full distribution TAR archive including runtime libraries and OS specific scripts.

[[sec:application_convention_properties]]
=== Convention properties

The application plugin adds some properties to the project, which you can use to configure its behaviour. See the api:org.gradle.api.Project[] class in the API documentation.
