== Web Application Quickstart

NOTE:  This chapter is a work in progress. 

This chapter introduces the Gradle support for web applications. Gradle provides two plugins for web application development: the War plugin and the Jetty plugin. The War plugin extends the Java plugin to build a WAR file for your project. The Jetty plugin extends the War plugin to allow you to deploy your web application to an embedded Jetty web container.


[[sec:building_a_war_file]]
=== Building a WAR file

To build a WAR file, you apply the War plugin to your project:

++++
<sample id="webQuickstart" dir="webApplication/quickstart" includeLocation="true" title="War plugin">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="use-war-plugin"/>
        </sample>
++++

This also applies the Java plugin to your project. Running [userinput]#gradle build# will compile, test and WAR your project. Gradle will look for the source files to include in the WAR file in `src/main/webapp`. Your compiled classes and their runtime dependencies are also included in the WAR file, in the `WEB-INF/classes` and `WEB-INF/lib` directories, respectively.

TIP: .Groovy web applications

You can combine multiple plugins in a single project, so you can use the War and Groovy plugins together to build a Groovy based web application. The appropriate Groovy libraries will be added to the WAR file for you.

[[sec:running_your_web_application]]
=== Running your web application

To run your web application, you apply the Jetty plugin to your project:

++++
<sample id="webQuickstart" dir="webApplication/quickstart" title="Running web application with Jetty plugin">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="use-jetty-plugin"/>
        </sample>
++++

This also applies the War plugin to your project. Running [userinput]#gradle jettyRun# will run your web application in an embedded Jetty web container. Running [userinput]#gradle jettyRunWar# will build the WAR file, and then run it in an embedded web container.

TODO: which url, configure port, uses source files in place and can edit your files and reload.

=== Summary

You can find out more about the War plugin in <<war_plugin>> and the Jetty plugin in <<jetty_plugin>>. You can find more sample Java projects in the `samples/webApplication` directory in the Gradle distribution.
