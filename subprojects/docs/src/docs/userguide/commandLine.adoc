[[gradle_command_line]]
== Gradle Command Line

The `gradle` command has the following usage: <cmdsynopsis> `gradle`  <arg choice="opt" rep="repeat">option</arg>  <arg choice="opt" rep="repeat">task</arg> </cmdsynopsis> The command-line options available for the `gradle` command are listed below:

`-?`, `-h`, `--help` ::Shows a help message.`-a`, `--no-rebuild` ::Do not rebuild project dependencies. `--all` ::Shows additional detail in the task listing. See <<sec:listing_tasks>>.`-b`, `--build-file` ::Specifies the build file. See <<sec:selecting_build>>.`-c`, `--settings-file` ::Specifies the settings file. `--console` ::Specifies which type of console output to generate.

Set to `plain` to generate plain text only. This option disables all color and other rich output in the console output.

Set to `auto` (the default) to enable color and other rich output in the console output when the build process is attached to a console, or to generate plain text only when not attached to a console.

Set to `rich` to enable color and other rich output in the console output, regardless of whether the build process is not attached to a console. When not attached to a console, the build output will use ANSI control characters to generate the rich output. `--continue` ::Continues task execution after a task failure. `--configure-on-demand (incubating)` ::Only relevant projects are configured in this build run. This means faster builds for large multi-projects. See <<sec:configuration_on_demand>>.`-D`, `--system-prop` ::Sets a system property of the JVM, for example `-Dmyprop=myvalue`. See <<sec:gradle_properties_and_system_properties>>.`-d`, `--debug` ::Log in debug mode (includes normal stacktrace). See <<logging>>.`-g`, `--gradle-user-home` ::Specifies the Gradle user home directory. The default is the `.gradle` directory in the user's home directory. `--gui` ::Launches the Gradle GUI. See <<tutorial_gradle_gui>>.

The Gradle GUI has been deprecated and will be removed in Gradle 4.0. Consider using an IDE with support for Gradle e.g. https://eclipse.org/[Eclipse], https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ] or https://netbeans.org/[NetBeans] instead.`--include-build` ::Run the build as a composite, including the specified build. See <<composite_builds>>.`-I`, `--init-script` ::Specifies an initialization script. See <<init_scripts>>.`-i`, `--info` ::Set log level to info. See <<logging>>.`-m`, `--dry-run` ::Runs the build with all task actions disabled. See <<sec:dry_run>>. `--offline` ::Specifies that the build should operate without accessing network resources. See <<sec:cache_command_line_options>>.`-P`, `--project-prop` ::Sets a project property of the root project, for example `-Pmyprop=myvalue`. See <<sec:gradle_properties_and_system_properties>>.`-p`, `--project-dir` ::Specifies the start directory for Gradle. Defaults to current directory. See <<sec:selecting_build>>. `--parallel (incubating)` ::Build projects in parallel. Gradle will attempt to determine the optimal number of executor threads to use. This option should only be used with decoupled projects (see <<sec:decoupled_projects>>). For limitations of this option please see <<sec:parallel_execution>>. `--max-workers (incubating)` ::Sets the maximum number of workers that Gradle may use. For example`--max-workers=3`. The default is the number of processors. `--profile` ::Profiles build execution time and generates a report in the `<replaceable>buildDir</replaceable>/reports/profile` directory. See <<sec:profiling_build>>. `--project-cache-dir` ::Specifies the project-specific cache directory. Default value is `.gradle` in the root project directory.`-q`, `--quiet` ::Log errors only. See <<logging>>. `--recompile-scripts` ::Forces scripts to be recompiled, bypassing caching. `--refresh-dependencies` ::Refresh the state of dependencies. See <<sec:cache_command_line_options>>. `--rerun-tasks` ::Specifies that any task optimization is ignored.`-S`, `--full-stacktrace` ::Print out the full (very verbose) stacktrace for any exceptions. See <<logging>>.`-s`, `--stacktrace` ::Print out the stacktrace also for user exceptions (e.g. compile error). See <<logging>>.`--scan (incubating)` ::Creates a build scan. Gradle will emit a warning if the build scan plugin has not been applied. For more information about build scans, please visit https://gradle.com/scans[https://gradle.com/scans].`--no-scan (incubating)` ::Disables the creation of a build scan. For more information about build scans, please visit https://gradle.com/scans[https://gradle.com/scans]. `-t`, `--continuous (incubating)` ::Enables <<continuous_build,continuous building>> - Gradle will automatically re-run when changes are detected.`-u`, `--no-search-upward` ::Don't search in parent directories for a `settings.gradle` file.`-v`, `--version` ::Prints version info. `-w`, `--warn` ::Set log level to warn. See <<logging>>`-x`, `--exclude-task` ::Specifies a task to be excluded from execution. See <<sec:excluding_tasks_from_the_command_line>>.

The above information is printed to the console when you execute [userinput]#gradle -h#.


[[daemon_cli]]
=== Daemon command-line options

The <<gradle_daemon>> contains more information about the daemon. For example it includes information how to turn on the daemon by default so that you can avoid using `--daemon` all the time.

 `--daemon` ::Uses the Gradle daemon to run the build. Starts the daemon if not running or existing daemon busy. <<gradle_daemon>> contains more detailed information when new daemon processes are started. `--foreground` ::Starts the Gradle daemon in the foreground. Useful for debugging or troubleshooting because you can easily monitor the build execution. `--no-daemon` ::Do not use the Gradle daemon to run the build. Useful occasionally if you have configured Gradle to always run with the daemon by default. `--status` ::List running and recently stopped Gradle daemons. Only displays daemons of the same Gradle version. `--stop` ::Stops the Gradle daemon if it is running. You can only stop daemons that were started with the Gradle version you use when running `--stop`.


[[sec:cli_system_properties]]
=== System properties

The following system properties are available for the `gradle` command. Note that command-line options take precedence over system properties.
 `gradle.user.home` ::Specifies the Gradle user home directory.
The <<sec:gradle_configuration_properties>> contains specific information about Gradle configuration available via system properties.

[[sec:cli_environment_variables]]
=== Environment variables

The following environment variables are available for the `gradle` command. Note that command-line options and system properties take precedence over environment variables.

 `GRADLE_OPTS` ::Specifies command-line arguments to use to start the JVM. This can be useful for setting the system properties to use for running Gradle. For example you could set `GRADLE_OPTS="-Dorg.gradle.daemon=true"` to use the Gradle daemon without needing to use the `--daemon` option every time you run Gradle. <<sec:gradle_configuration_properties>> contains more information about ways of configuring the daemon without using environmental variables, e.g. in more maintainable and explicit way. `GRADLE_USER_HOME` ::Specifies the Gradle user home directory (which defaults to “`USER_HOME/.gradle`” if not set). `JAVA_HOME` ::Specifies the JDK installation directory to use.
