== The Java Library Distribution Plugin

NOTE:  The Java library distribution plugin is currently <<feature_lifecycle,incubating>>. Please be aware that the DSL and other configuration may change in later Gradle versions. 

The Java library distribution plugin adds support for building a distribution ZIP for a Java library. The distribution contains the JAR file for the library and its dependencies.


[[sec:java_library_distribution_usage]]
=== Usage

To use the Java library distribution plugin, include the following in your build script:

++++
<sample id="usejavaLibraryPlugin" dir="userguide/javaLibraryDistribution" title="Using the Java library distribution plugin">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="use-plugin"/>
        </sample>
++++

To define the name for the distribution you have to set the `baseName` property as shown below:

++++
<sample id="useApplicationPlugin" dir="userguide/javaLibraryDistribution" title="Configure the distribution name">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="name-conf"/>
        </sample>
++++

The plugin builds a distribution for your library. The distribution will package up the runtime dependencies of the library. All files stored in `src/main/dist` will be added to the root of the archive distribution. You can run “[userinput]#gradle distZip#” to create a ZIP file containing the distribution.

[[java_library_distribution_resources]]
=== Including other resources in the distribution

All of the files from the `src/dist` directory are copied. To include any static files in the distribution, simply arrange them in the `src/dist` directory, or add them to the content of the distribution.
