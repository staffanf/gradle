== The Announce Plugin

The Gradle announce plugin allows you to send custom announcements during a build. The following notification systems are supported:

* http://twitter.com[Twitter]
* http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/gutsy/man1/notify-send.1.html[notify-send] (Ubuntu)
* https://sites.google.com/site/snarlapp/home[Snarl] (Windows)
* http://growl.info/[Growl] (Mac OS X)
 


[[sec:announce_usage]]
=== Usage

To use the announce plugin, apply it to your build script:

++++
<sample id="useAnnouncePlugin" dir="announce" title="Using the announce plugin">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="use-plugin"/>
        </sample>
++++

Next, configure your notification service(s) of choice (see table below for which configuration properties are available):

++++
<sample id="useAnnouncePlugin" dir="announce" title="Configure the announce plugin">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="announce-plugin-conf"/>
        </sample>
++++

Finally, send announcements with the `announce` method:

++++
<sample id="useAnnouncePlugin" dir="announce" title="Using the announce plugin">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="announce-usage"/>
        </sample>
++++

The `announce` method takes two String arguments: The message to be sent, and the notification service to be used. The following table lists supported notification services and their configuration properties.
