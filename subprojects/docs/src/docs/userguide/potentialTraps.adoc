[[sec:groovy_script_variables]]
=== Groovy script variables

For Gradle users it is important to understand how Groovy deals with script variables. Groovy has two types of script variables. One with a local scope and one with a script-wide scope.

++++
<sample xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" id="scope" dir="userguide/tutorial" title="Variables scope: local and script wide">
            <sourcefile file="scope.groovy"/>
            <output args=""/>
        </sample>
++++

Variables which are declared with a type modifier are visible within closures but not visible within methods. This is a heavily discussed behavior in the Groovy community. footnote:[One of those discussions can be found here: http://groovy.329449.n5.nabble.com/script-scoping-question-td355887.html[] ] 

[[sec:configuration_and_execution_phase]]
=== Configuration and execution phase

It is important to keep in mind that Gradle has a distinct configuration and execution phase (see <<build_lifecycle>>).

++++
<sample xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" id="mkdirTrap" dir="userguide/tutorial/mkdirTrap" title="Distinct configuration and execution phase">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle"/>
            <output args="-q compile"/>
        </sample>
++++

As the creation of the directory happens during the configuration phase, the `clean` task removes the directory during the execution phase.
