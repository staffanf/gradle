== Implementing model rules in a plugin

A plugin can define rules by extending api:org.gradle.model.RuleSource[] and adding methods that define the rules. The plugin class can either extend api:org.gradle.model.RuleSource[] directly or can implement api:org.gradle.api.Plugin[] and include a nested api:org.gradle.model.RuleSource[] subclass.

Refer to the API docs for api:org.gradle.model.RuleSource[] for more details.

=== Applying additional rules

A rule method annotated with api:org.gradle.model.Rules[] can apply a api:org.gradle.model.RuleSource[] to a target model element.
