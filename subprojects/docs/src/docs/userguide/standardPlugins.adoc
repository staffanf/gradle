[[sec:base_plugins]]
=== Base plugins

These plugins form the basic building blocks which the other plugins are assembled from. They are available for you to use in your build files, and are listed here for completeness. However, be aware that they are not yet considered part of Gradle's public API. As such, these plugins are not documented in the user guide. You might refer to their API documentation to learn more about them.

.Base plugins
[cols="a,a"]
|===
| Plugin Id
| Description

| base
| Adds the standard lifecycle tasks and configures reasonable defaults for the archive tasks: 

* adds build <replaceable>ConfigurationName</replaceable> tasks. Those tasks assemble the artifacts belonging to the specified configuration.
* adds upload <replaceable>ConfigurationName</replaceable> tasks. Those tasks assemble and upload the artifacts belonging to the specified configuration.
* configures reasonable default values for all archive tasks (e.g. tasks that inherit from api:org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.AbstractArchiveTask[]). For example, the archive tasks are tasks of types: api:org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Jar[], api:org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Tar[], api:org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Zip[]. Specifically, `destinationDir`, `baseName` and `version` properties of the archive tasks are preconfigured with defaults. This is extremely useful because it drives consistency across projects; the consistency regarding naming conventions of archives and their location after the build completed.
 

| java-base
| Adds the source sets concept to the project. Does not add any particular source sets.

| groovy-base
| Adds the Groovy source sets concept to the project.

| scala-base
| Adds the Scala source sets concept to the project.

| reporting-base
